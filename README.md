# Training neural audio classifiers with few data

We investigate supervised learning strategies that improve the training of neural network audio classifiers on small annotated collections. In particular, we study whether (i) a naive regularization of the solution space, (ii) prototypical networks, (iii) transfer learning, or (iv) their combination, can foster deep learning models to better leverage a small amount of training examples. To this end, we evaluate (i-iv) for the tasks of acoustic event recognition and acoustic scene classification, considering from 1 to 100 labeled examples per class. Results indicate that transfer learning is a powerful strategy in such scenarios, but prototypical networks show promising results when one does not count with external or validation data. 

This repository contains code to reproduce the results of our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10274).

## Reproduce our results

#### Download the data:
Download [US8K dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html), and ASC-TUT dataset ([dev-set](https://zenodo.org/record/400515#.W9n2UtGdZhE) / [eval-set](https://zenodo.org/record/1040168#.W9n2jNGdZhE)).

#### Installation:
Create a python 3 virtual environment and install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Install tensorflow for CPU `pip install tensorflow` or for CUDA-enabled GPU `pip install tensorflow-gpu`

Be sure to have `ffmpeg` installed, as well.

#### Preprocess the data:
To preprocess the data, first set some `config_file.py` variables:
- `DATA_FOLDER`, where you want to store all your intermediate files (see folders structure below).
- `config_preprocess['audio_folder']`, where your dataset is located.

Preprocess the data running `python preprocess.py asc_spec`. Note `asc_spec` config option is defined in `config_file.py`

After running `preprocess.py`, spectrograms are in `../DATA_FOLDER/audio_representation/asc__time-freq/`

_*Warning!*_ Rename `index_0.tsv` to `index.tsv`. This is because this script is parallelizable.

#### Regularized deep learning results:

Set `config_sl` dictionary in `config_file.py`, and run `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python sl_train.py spec`

Once training is done, the resulting model is stored in `../DATA_FOLDER/experiments/fold_0_1541174334/`

To evaluate the model, run `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python sl_evaluate.py fold_0_1541174334`

#### Prototypical networks results:

Set `config_proto` dictionary in `config_file.py`, and run `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python proto.py spec`

#### Transfer learning results:
We also study the effectiveness of transfer learning. For that, we use a VGG model pre-trained with Audioset, a dataset conformed by 2 M YouTube audios. This model is available [online](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset).

For being able to run transfer learning experiments, you just need to download the [VGGish model checkpoint](https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt) `vggish_model.ckpt`, and copy it to `/src`.

Then, you can run `transfer_proto.py` following the same logic as in `proto.py`. Now via setting `config_proto` dictionary in `config_file.py`

And you can also run `transfer_train.py` and `transfer_evaluate.py` following the same logic as in `transfer_sl.py` and `transfer_sl.py`. Now via setting `config_transfer_proto` dictionary in `config_file.py`

## Scripts

**Configuration** and preprocessing scripts:
- `config_file.py`: file with all configurable parameters.
- `preprocess.py`: pre-computes and stores the spectrograms.

Scripts for **regularized deep learning models** experiments:
- `sl_train.py`: run it to train your model. First set `config_sl` in `config_file.py`
- `sl_evaluate.py`: run it to evaluate the previously trained model.
- `models_sl.py`: script where the architectures are defined.

Scripts for **prototypical networks** experiments:
- `proto.py`: run it to reproduce our prototypical networks' results. First set `config_proto` in `config_file.py`
- `models_proto.py`: script where the architectures are defined.

Scripts for **transfer learning** experiments:
- `transfer_train.py`: run it to reproduce our transfer learning (with finetuning) results. First set `config_transfer` in `config_file.py`
- `transfer_evaluate.py`: run it to evaluate the previously trained model.
- `transfer_proto.py`: run it to reproduce our prototypical networks' results. First set `config_transfer_proto` in `config_file.py`

Auxiliar scripts:
- `knn_audioset.py`: run it to reproduce our nearest-neigbour Audioset results.
- `knn_mfcc.py`: run it to reproduce our nearest-neigbour MFCCs results.
- `shared.py`: auxiliar script with shared functions that are used by other scripts.
- `vggish_input.py`,`vggish_params.py`,`vggish_slim.py`,`mel_features.py`,`vggish_model.ckpt`: auxiliar scripts for transfer learning experiments.

## Folders structure

- `/src`: folder containing previous scripts.
- `/aux`: folder containing auxiliar additional scripts. These are used to generate the index files in `/data/index/`.
- `/data`: where all intermediate files (spectrograms, results, etc.) will be stored. 
- `/data/index/`: indexed files containing the correspondences between audio files and their ground truth.

When running previous scripts, the following folders will be created:
- `./data/audio_representation/`: where spectrogram patches are stored.
- `./data/experiments/`: where the results of the experiments are stored.
